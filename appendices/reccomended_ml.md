## Recommendation Engine Architecture

A hybrid recommendation system that combines:

1. **Collaborative Filtering Component**
   - User-similarity matrix based on past facility choices
   - User cohort analysis to identify behavioral patterns
   - Cold-start handling for new users based on demographic data

2. **Content-Based Component**
   - Facility feature vector extraction (equipment types, class offerings, etc.)
   - User preference vector derived from past interactions and explicit preferences
   - Geographic proximity weighting based on the district analysis

3. **Contextual Boosting Layer**
   - Time-of-day adaptation (morning vs. evening preferences)
   - Weather-based recommendations (indoor options during poor weather)
   - Special events/promotions integration

## Implementation Advantages

This recommendation engine would be ideal because:

1. **Direct Revenue Impact**: 1fit's data shows users with personalized recommendations have 73% higher retention rates

2. **Leverages Existing Feature Importance**: Utilizes the top predictive features we've already identified (exercise frequency, location, demographics)

3. **Differentiates from Competitors**: Most Hong Kong fitness apps use basic filtering rather than sophisticated recommendations

4. **Scalable Architecture**: Can start with simple collaborative filtering and progressively enhance with more complex features

5. **Proven Model**: Similar recommendation engines have driven 1fit's success in other markets (as mentioned in their interview)

## Technical Implementation Example

```python
# Pseudocode for recommendation engine architecture
class FitnessRecommender:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collaborative_model = CollaborativeFilteringModel()
        self.content_model = ContentBasedModel()
        self.context_model = ContextualBoostingModel()
        
    def train(self, user_data, facility_data, interaction_history):
        self.collaborative_model.train(interaction_history)
        self.content_model.train(user_data, facility_data)
        self.context_model.train(interaction_history, time_data, weather_data)
        
    def get_recommendations(self, user_id, current_context):
        # Get base recommendations from each model
        collab_recs = self.collaborative_model.predict(user_id)
        content_recs = self.content_model.predict(user_id)
        
        # Merge recommendations with weighting
        merged_recs = self.merge_recommendations(collab_recs, content_recs)
        
        # Apply contextual boosting
        final_recs = self.context_model.boost(merged_recs, current_context)
        
        return final_recs
```

This approach aligns perfectly with your phased district expansion strategy, as the recommendation engine can be optimized for each district's unique characteristics while maintaining a consistent user experience across the platform.
