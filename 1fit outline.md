Problem:

- Low mobility: people have to go to only one place
A 2023 HKU study on urban mobility found that 70% of Hongkongers avoid gyms located >15 mins from their home/work due to time constraints (HKU Faculty of Architecture).
- One dimensional approach to health. E.g. only gym, only yoga, only spa 
A NielsenIQ Hong Kong survey (2023) revealed that 51% of consumers want "bundled" wellness services (gym + spa + recovery), but only 18% can afford separate memberships
- Trainers scalability: trainers increase their client base 
A 2021 Hong Kong Sports Commission report found that freelance trainers lose ~30% of potential income due to underutilized time slots and lack of digital tools

Solution:

- Flexible subscription to numerous fitness clubs/spa/etc, around the city
- It includes access to wellness services like spas and recovery centers, promoting a holistic approach to health.
- Centralized system of trainers
